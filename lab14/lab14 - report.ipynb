(2015) obtained superhuman playing ability for some of the Atari games by combining DQN with experience replay and a more sophisticated state representation that what we've seen so far: they stack successive frames as the input state representation so as to give the agent some \"velocity\" input rather than a static snapshot of the scene.\n",
